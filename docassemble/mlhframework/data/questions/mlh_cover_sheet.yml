# Used to set up and populate a dynamic ALDocument cover page, which can then be
# included in a tool's ALDocumentBundle.
# Can be included in a form packet's ALDocumentBundle as either an individual file or along
# with instructions or other reference material.
# 1. As Individual file, include this code in local yml file:
#    ---
#    objects:
#      - al_cover: ALDocumentBundle.using(elements=[cover_sheet_template], filename="Instructions - Do 
#        not file this", title="Instructions", enabled=True)
# 2. As part of a combined file ('instructions' is an ALDocument defined locally):
#    ---
#    objects:
#      - al_cover_bundle: >-
#          ALDocumentBundle.using(elements=[cover_sheet_template, instructions],
#          filename="Instructions - Do not file this", title="Instructions", 
#          enabled=True)
# Include al_cover or al_cover_bundle (as appropriate) in al_user_bundle
# Note that any of the cover_sheet_X strings can be overridden in a program's local yml.
