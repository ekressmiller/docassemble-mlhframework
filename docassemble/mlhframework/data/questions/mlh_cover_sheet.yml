# Used to set up and populate a dynamic ALDocument cover page, which can then be
# included in a tool's ALDocumentBundle.
# Can be included in a form packet's ALDocumentBundle as either an individual file or along
# with instructions or other reference material.
# 1. As Individual file, include this code in local yml file:
#    ---
#    objects:
#      - al_cover: ALDocumentBundle.using(elements=[cover_sheet_template], filename="Cover Sheet",
#        title="Cover Sheet", enabled=True)
# 2. As part of a combined file ('instructions' is an ALDocument defined locally):
#    ---
#    objects:
#      - al_cover_bundle: >-
#          ALDocumentBundle.using(elements=[cover_sheet_template, instructions],
#          filename="Cover sheet and instructions", title="Instructions", enabled=True)
#      - al_cover_bundle_download: >-
#          ALDocumentBundle.using(elements=[al_cover_bundle], 
#          filename="not applicable", title="not applicable", enabled=True)
#    Then use al_cover_bundle_download.download_list_html() to render the above download onscreen.
#
# Note that any of the cover_sheet_X strings can be overridden in a program's local yml.
